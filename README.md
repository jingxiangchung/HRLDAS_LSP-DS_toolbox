# HRLDAS_LSP-DS_toolbox
A repo of scripts to make using HRLDAS LSP-DS easier.

Based on WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS 

Scripts:
1. libsetwrf.sh: a script to help in compiling libraries needed to compile WRF and WPS binaries for HRLDAS LSP-DS.

  note:

  i. requires root to install the prerequisites.

  ii. I cannot get Intel OneAPI's compilers to compile Jasper 1.9, thus I am using GNU compilers instead.

2. to be added.
